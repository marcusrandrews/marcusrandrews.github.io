My mix which I used last year and worked surprisingly well. This mix is ultimately fairly inert and allows good drainage and relies on Canna nuts for the most part which I think are the best. <br>
	- 5L Perlite (aeration)<br>
	- 5L sand (drainage)<br>
	- 20L organic Herb and Veggie mix (Initially where the plant will feed from, this will be depleted during the vegetative stage. Try to avoid stuff with Osmocote in it).<br>
	- 10L seed raising mix (for volume and also use a hand full of this to start off the seed after germination)<br>
	- 9L Coco Coir Peat Brick (helps aerate the soil and hold moisture and sponginess)<br>
<br>
	Nutrients: <br>
	- bioCanna Vega 1L (for 1 plant and 1 season I’ve found 250ml of any of these bottles in enough, if you are doing 4 plants buy the 1L bottle)<br>
	- bioCanna Flores 1L<br>
	- bioCanna Boost 1L<br>
	- bioCanna Rhizotonic 1L<br>
	- Canna PK 13/14 250ml (you will only need 250ml, it will lat for years)<br>
	- a bottle of Calcium Magnesium - cal/mag bio Diesel marine cal/mag works well 250ml (this is plenty for a few plants for a season or 2)<br>

	- High Powered Organics Anti Matter & Dark Matter from Fyshwick hydro store<br>
	#I recommend this, is at the Fyshwick hydro store, and I just mixed a teaspoon of each with the canna nutes every so often and let it be for a few hours before feeding plants. This is putting micro bacteria into <br>the soil. This is the reason you want to avoid Osmocote and that stuff make too high of a salt barrier in the soil which can inhibit the bacteria. <br>
<br>
<br>
# Mix it all together, this makes 49L, which I’d say should be a minimum pot size(50L, close enough). A 100L pot would probably be best for a whole season. Or even 2 x 75L.<br>
# Grow using geo fabric pots from hydro store on top of a pot base to collect water.<br>
# Germinate the seeds in like 8 toilet paper squares in a small airtight container with some distilled/rainwater, I sometimes wrap it in a cloth and sit it on a lamp for heat, mid 20 degrees is good. Should 	<br>	 germinated in 1-4 days, plant in a small pot of seed raising mix sprout down only about 1cm deep, go it in here for a couple of weeks.<br>
<br>
# Only water with rainwater or distilled water (or you can use mains water if you let the chlorine evaporate out of it over a few days in a bucket).<br>
# Once the seedling is established, gently transfer it into the main pot.<br>
# You will not need to use nutrients for a while during early vegetative stage as the plant will be feeding off the vegetables mix and seed raising mix.<br>
# After about the first month or 2 when the plant is starting to put on a little size begin using the bioCanna Vega, start at half dos a slowly ramp up over the next few weeks. Be using the Rhizotonic as required though, it’s a root stimulator.<br>
# https://astirgrows.com/en/content/16-biocanna-feeding-chart here is the bioCanna Feeding schedule<br>
# when the plant begins flowering you will need to start watering more, droopy leave occur both from over and under watering.<br>
# I suggest using PK 13/14 at like 70% strength every 2nd day of week 5 flowering.<br>
