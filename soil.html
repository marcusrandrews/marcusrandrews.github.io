<p>Ingredients for the Dough. (Makes 4 bases at around 300g each)<br>
710g Strong Bakers Flour ( and 40g on the side; kneading, rolling out bases - 750g total, you can use more flour if needed while rolling bases etc but I try keep the hydration true to this recipe.)<br>
500g Water (warm if intending on eating that day, cool water if for tomorrow)<br>
15g Sea Salt Flakes (I mortar and pestle them a little finer)<br>
5g Instant Yeast (if you could get fresh yeast it would probably be better)<br>
<br>
Silicone spatula very handy as it really helps remove dough from the walls of the bowl<br>
Use scales and be precise.<br>
<br>
Making the bases you will need:<br>
Coursely ground semolina OR olive oil<br>
Baking paper<br>
<br>
NOTE: I have just recently seen that another way to transfer the bases into the oven is by oiling the actually baking paper throughly and then putting the rolled out base directly on this so it doesn’t stick, but I have not tried this way yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Making The Dough:<br>
1. Combine in large bowl flour & salt, mix lightly to even out salt.<br>
2. Measure out 500g water in a measuring jug.<br>
3. Add a couple of tablespoons of flour/salt mix to water jug.<br>
4. Add yeast to the water/flour/salt jug, mix and let sit for a few minutes.<br>
5. Add yeast jug mixture to the flour/salt bowl and combine as best you can with silicone spatula.<br>
6. Cover bowl with a damp cloth for 20-60 mins, whatever, just give the flour time to absorb the moisture.<br>
7. Remove cloth and use spatula to mix and knead dough in bowl and collect it back together.<br>
8. Here you have a choice:<br>
9. IF USING TODAY: then flour the bench with some of the 40g and remove the dough from the bowl and give it a proper knead and then cut it into 4 balls but them in a flat tray with high walls and cover with a wet cloth<br>
10.  IF USING TOMORROW: Just give it a quick knead with the spatula in the bowl and then cover with a damp cloth and place in the fridge to rise, keep the 40g of flour for tomorrow. When tomorrow comes I remove the dough, give it a quick knead and seperate it into balls and then put in tray to rise like above with damp cloth and allow the balls to get back to room temp.<br>

Making Pizza<br>
<br>
I will mention 2 methods, figure out what works for you.<br>
Ive been using the semolina method recently and have been very happy with it plus I like the semolina texture on the base of the pizza but depends on what you are going for  at the time I guess.<br>
<br>
Coarsely ground Semolina OR Olive oil - these are to be used as release agents from the baking paper during cooking.<br>
Baking paper<br>
<br>
Semolina Method:<br>
1. Lay out piece of baking paper. About 1.5 times the length of a pizza base and then cover the top 2/3rd’s of the baking paper with a generous coating of semolina.<br>
2. Roll out pizza base, while always keeping other bases covered with damp cloth) on a floured bench to about 5mm thick or less, use as little flour as possible to try keep the hydration the sam and not to overload the pizza with flour texture<br>
3. Transfer pizza base to the baking paper neatly<br>
4. Add ingredients to pizza.<br>
5. You can easily slide your pizza peel under the base and transfer into the pizza oven, leave the baking paper under the pizza.<br>
6. After about 30-60secs the pizza should have released from the baking paper and using your hands and the pizza peel remove the baking paper.<br>
7. Finish cooking pizza.<br>
<br>
Olive oil method:<br>
Haven’t tried this only recently learned about it but instead of covering the baking paper with semolina use a teaspoon of olive oil and distribute it on the top 2/3rds of the baking paper and only try to remove the paper after cooking the base for 30-60secs.<br>
